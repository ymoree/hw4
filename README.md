# Template driven forms
Template-driven forms are just model-driven forms but driven by directives in the the template versus code in the component. In template-driven we use directives to create the model. In model-driven we create a model on the component and then use directives to map elements in the template to our form model.
# Reactive forms
Reactive forms are built around observable streams, where form inputs and values are provided as streams of input values, which can be accessed synchronously. Reactive forms also provide a straightforward path to testing because you are assured that your data is consistent and predictable when requested.
